Medical Prediction Analysis and Comparison
This project analyzes medical prediction data, comparing doctor evaluations and model (AI) predictions, with a focus on cancer predictions. It assesses prediction accuracy, generates advanced metrics (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, etc.), performs statistical tests, and generates interactive visualizations and reports for comprehensive insights.

Features
Data Loading and Cleaning: Automatically loads and prepares data from .csv and .xlsx files.
Descriptive Statistics: Computes summary statistics and visualizes distributions.
Feature Selection: Identifies important features and reduces dataset redundancy.
Statistical Testing: Performs independent t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and correlation analysis between doctor and model predictions.
Advanced Metrics Calculation: Calculates accuracy metrics, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, F1 score, MCC, Kappa score, and AUC with confidence intervals via bootstrapping.
Interactive Visualizations: Uses Plotly to create interactive ROC curves, scatter plots, and histograms.
Automated HTML Report: Generates a comprehensive HTML report with analysis results, visualizations, and interpretations.
